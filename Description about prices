Welcome to the house-prediction wiki!
First  I have taken  house prediction data
That data contains information like a price and area- sqft
From this data will clean the data and keep in table format
We  have  represent the data in scatter plot 
And after that we have  applied  machine learning algorithms like  linear regression
Linear regression Here : Y = mx + b 
Here price is dependent variable and  area is independent variable 
At last we can predict the price of any unknown house 
To predict house price we must give data  area
